    <h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Steps to Take Care While Transporting and Warehousing Food Products</h2>
    <p>Insect infestation due to the humid and unhygienic conditions of the warehouse is a huge menace for food grains, legumes, and spices. To resolve this problem, professional individuals should closely monitor the storage conditions and ensure that infested grains from fields do not reach the warehouse and become a threat to healthy grains. To improve the quality of grains, they should keep track of incoming and outgoing samples along with their dates. During the monsoon season and in highly humid areas, extra care must be taken to prevent spoilage of grains. Design a warehouse with a proper storage environment that minimizes the risk of contamination.</p>

The general public should avoid eating dark-colored, junk, and other processed foods. Washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly in running water before consumption is recommended. Check for leakages in canned foods and validate seals in milk or oil pouches. Always check and buy products with an FSSAI-validated label, license number, list of ingredients, manufacturing date, and expiration.</p>
